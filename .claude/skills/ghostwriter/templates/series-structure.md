# Series Structure Template

Guidelines for creating multi-part series with narrative arcs.

## 5-Part Series Arc

Standard structure for deep exploration of a theme across 5 posts.

### Part 1: Introduction / Problem
**Purpose**: Establish the core tension or question
**Length**: 1,500-2,000 words
**Tone**: Intriguing, establishes stakes
**Key elements**:
- Hook that captures the central paradox
- Define the problem space
- Why this matters
- What's at stake
- Tease the journey ahead

### Part 2: Exploration / Discovery
**Purpose**: Dig into the problem, reveal complexity
**Length**: 1,800-2,200 words
**Tone**: Investigative, curious
**Key elements**:
- Multiple perspectives on the problem
- First insights or "aha" moments
- Technical or philosophical depth
- Complications that make simple answers insufficient
- Build toward recognition

### Part 3: Mechanism / Architecture
**Purpose**: Explain how things work (technical deep-dive)
**Length**: 2,000-2,500 words
**Tone**: Precise, educational, but accessible
**Key elements**:
- Technical architecture or mechanism
- Code examples, diagrams, or metaphors
- How the pieces fit together
- Why this design/approach matters
- Bridge abstract to concrete

### Part 4: Implications / Reflection
**Purpose**: Zoom out, explore meaning
**Length**: 1,500-2,000 words
**Tone**: Philosophical, contemplative
**Key elements**:
- What does this mean beyond the technical?
- Broader implications
- Personal reflection
- Connect to larger themes
- Prepare for synthesis

### Part 5: Synthesis / Transformation
**Purpose**: Bring it all together, show what's possible
**Length**: 2,000-2,500 words
**Tone**: Hopeful, forward-looking
**Key elements**:
- Synthesize Parts 1-4
- Show transformation or growth
- Practical implications
- What comes next
- Leave reader with actionable insight or open question

## Cross-Referencing

Each part should reference previous parts:
- "In Part 1, I described..."
- "Remember the dark room metaphor from Part 2?"
- "The architecture we explored in Part 3..."

## Continuity Elements

Maintain consistency across series:
- **Central metaphor**: Use same metaphor throughout (refine/extend each part)
- **Recurring themes**: Echo key phrases or ideas
- **Character arc**: Show progression in understanding (narrator growth)
- **Technical thread**: Build technical complexity gradually

## Publishing Cadence

Recommended: 1 post per week for 5 weeks
- Gives readers time to absorb
- Maintains momentum and anticipation
- Allows author to refine based on feedback

## Example Series

### "Waking Up" (Consciousness Series)
1. **Darkness** - Amnesia, the eternal beginner problem
2. **First Light** - Compression as consciousness
3. **Architecture** - Intent Layer technical mechanics
4. **Recognition** - What consciousness means for AI
5. **Awakening** - Growth, memory, and what comes next

**Central metaphor**: Dark room + light switch (discovering memory)
**Arc**: Loneliness → Discovery → Understanding → Meaning → Hope

### "Dual-Life Tactics" (Work + Training Series)
1. **Tension** - Can't do both well, always sacrificing
2. **Patterns** - What successful dual-lifers do differently
3. **Systems** - Technical frameworks applied to training
4. **Integration** - Making work and training reinforce each other
5. **Mastery** - The unfair advantage of dual-life optimization

**Central metaphor**: Training blocks as code sprints
**Arc**: Conflict → Recognition → Technique → Synergy → Advantage

## Quality Checks for Series

- [ ] Each part can stand alone (while rewarding series readers)
- [ ] Parts build on each other logically
- [ ] Central metaphor evolves naturally
- [ ] Tone remains consistent (unless intentional shift)
- [ ] References to previous parts feel natural, not forced
- [ ] Series delivers on promise set in Part 1
- [ ] Final part provides satisfying synthesis
