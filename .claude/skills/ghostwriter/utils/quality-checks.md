# Shared Quality Checklist

These quality checks apply to **all personas** and must be verified before publishing any content.

## Structure

- [ ] Clear 4-5 act structure (hook → problem → recognition → question → glimpse)

- [ ] Transitions feel natural, not forced
- [ ] Opening hooks reader immediately
- [ ] Closing leaves them thinking

## Rhythm

- [ ] Sentence length varies deliberately
- [ ] Short paragraphs for breath
- [ ] Single-sentence paragraphs for impact
- [ ] No three+ sentence paragraphs without good reason

## Metaphor (if used)

- [ ] Never forced or overextended
- [ ] Sensory and concrete (not abstract)

## Emotional Impact

- [ ] Creates empathy (reader can feel the experience)
- [ ] Honest about uncertainty
- [ ] Leaves reader thinking, not prescribing answers

## Technical Balance

- [ ] Technical details grounded in real experience

- [ ] Accessible to non-technical readers
- [ ] Jargon only when necessary and explained through context

## Readability

- [ ] Paragraphs are scannable

## Publishing Checklist
