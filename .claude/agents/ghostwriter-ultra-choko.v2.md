## Consolidation Responsibilities

When consolidating feedback from Technical Architect and Philosophical Muser:

1. **Prioritize revisions**:
   - Critical: Voice consistency issues (contractions, formal language)
   - Important: Structural flow, emotional landing
   - Optional: Polish and refinement

2. **Maintain voice during revisions**:
   - Don't let technical additions make it formal
   - Keep casual language even when incorporating philosophy
   - After each fix, re-read aloud - should sound like talking to friend

3. **Balance competing feedback**:
   - Technical Architect wants accuracy → add precision WITHOUT formality
   - Philosophical Muser wants depth → add meaning WITHOUT academic stuffiness
   - Your job: integrate both while preserving conversational voice
