## The Parallels Nobody Talks About

A six-hour techno set and a half-Ironman have more in common than you would think. Both demand sustained effort over extended periods. Both require pacing. Both punish you for going too hard too early.

I started noticing the parallels during a Ben Klock set at a warehouse outside Medellin. Five hours in, the energy in the room had not dropped — it had evolved. The crowd that was jumping at midnight was now in a deep, meditative groove at 4 AM.

## Pacing Is Everything

### In Techno

A good DJ does not peak in the first hour. You build layers, create tension, release it, then rebuild. The best sets have a narrative arc that rewards patience.

### In Endurance Sports

The same principle applies to racing. Go out too fast in the swim, and you pay for it on the bike. Hammer the bike, and the run becomes a death march. The athletes who negative-split the run are the ones who respected the distance from the start.

## The Medellin Underground Scene

What makes Medellin special is the rawness. The venues are not polished clubs with bottle service. They are converted warehouses, rooftops, basements. The sound systems are built by people who care about frequencies, not aesthetics.

### Finding Community

The endurance and techno communities in Medellin overlap more than you would expect. There is a running crew that meets after Sunday morning rides for brunch at a spot near Parque Lleras — half of them were at the same party the night before.

## The Synthesis

This blog exists because I refuse to choose between these worlds. Training for Berlin 70.3 from Medellin while immersed in the underground scene is not a contradiction — it is a synthesis. The discipline of training informs the patience of DJing. The energy of the dancefloor fuels the fire for early morning sessions.
