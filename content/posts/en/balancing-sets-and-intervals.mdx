## The Dual Life Problem

Friday night at 2 AM, you are behind the decks at a warehouse in El Poblado, watching the crowd lock into a groove you have been building for 45 minutes. Saturday morning at 6 AM, your alarm goes off for a long ride.

These two worlds are not supposed to coexist. Every triathlon blog tells you to sleep eight hours, eat clean, avoid alcohol. Every DJ knows the best sets happen when you are fully present, fully committed to the night.

## My Framework

<CalloutBox type="info" title="The 80/20 Rule, Remixed">
  80% of the time, follow the training plan religiously. 20% of the time, live the life that makes the training worth doing.
</CalloutBox>

### Training Blocks

I organize my weeks into training blocks that account for the nightlife schedule:

- **Monday to Thursday**: Full training commitment. Early mornings, quality sessions, proper nutrition.
- **Friday**: Easy session or rest day. This is the buffer.
- **Saturday**: Long session in the morning, regardless of Friday night. Non-negotiable.
- **Sunday**: Active recovery or complete rest depending on how the weekend went.

### The Recovery Stack

What I have learned is that recovery is not binary. You can have a late night and still get quality training in, if you manage the recovery actively.

## The Honest Truth

Some weekends, the balance tips. A three-hour set that turns into an after-party means Saturday's long ride becomes a zone 2 spin instead of threshold intervals. And that is fine. Consistency over perfection, always.

The goal is Berlin 70.3, but the journey is the whole point. And the journey includes both the track and the dancefloor.
