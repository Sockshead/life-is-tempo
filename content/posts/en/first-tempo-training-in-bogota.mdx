## Finding My Rhythm at 1,500m

There is something humbling about running tempo intervals at altitude. Back at sea level, a 4:30/km pace felt like cruising. Here in Medellin, that same pace has my heart rate spiking into zone 4 before the second kilometer.

<CalloutBox type="tip" title="Altitude Training Tip">
  Give yourself at least two weeks to acclimatize before attempting threshold workouts. Your easy pace will feel hard, and your hard pace will feel impossible.
</CalloutBox>

The plan was simple: 4x2km at tempo pace with 90-second recovery jogs. The execution was anything but.

## The Session Breakdown

### Interval One: The Rude Awakening

The first interval started strong. Legs felt fresh from yesterday's rest day, and the cool morning air at Parque Arvi kept things comfortable. By 800 meters, my watch was screaming — heart rate already at 172. I backed off slightly, finishing the rep at 4:45/km instead of the planned 4:30.

### Interval Two: Finding the Groove

Something clicked in the second rep. Maybe it was accepting that my sea-level paces do not apply here. I settled into a 4:50/km rhythm and held it steady. Heart rate stabilized around 168 — still high, but sustainable.

### The Takeaway

Training at altitude is not about hitting the same numbers you hit at sea level. It is about effort-based training. The heart rate does not lie, and neither does the lactate burning in your legs at kilometer six.

## What is Next

Tomorrow is an easy 10km with some strides. The real test comes Thursday with a long run that will simulate the run leg of Berlin 70.3 — minus the swim and bike fatigue, of course.
